Hello! I hope you enjoy my project (and have hopefully seen The Big Lebowski so it makes sense that it's more of a "get the reference/quote" game than it is actual trivia.) I apologize for the (albeit censored) profanity- the movie is full of it and it's hard to quote a line without it!

I know that something is messed up with my code for the Game History component that is causing it to function incorrectly, and I unfortunately did not have time to fix it. It looks like it may be a combination of an issue with the data I'm using for round/rounds and the props, and likely also an issue with my if/else statement in the method that determines wins vs. losses.
